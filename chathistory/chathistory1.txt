Joe: Hey, did you hear about the Java developer who walked into a bar?



Edwin: No, what happened?



Joe: He said, "Give me a strong cup of Java! And make it Object-Oriented!" ???



Onat: Haha, that's a good one, Joe! Speaking of Java, did you know that Monty Python's Holy Grail was written in Java?



Edwin: Really? I thought it was written in Python!



Onat: Well, that would make more sense, wouldn't it? But it seems they had a "Java Holy Grail" moment! ??



Joe: And let's not forget the Java programmers who always have to deal with "NullPointerExceptions."



Edwin: Yeah, they're like the Knights Who Say "Null"! They're always on a quest to find that elusive object.



Onat: True, true! And when they finally find it, they shout, "Eureka!" just like Archimedes.



Joe: Haha, the life of a Java developer can be quite the adventure, just like a Monty Python sketch!



Edwin: Indeed! But at the end of the day, we all know that "The Spam of Java is not a valid beverage!" ????



Onat: Well said, Edwin! Let's keep the Java and Python jokes rolling, and help our student's code be as legendary as a Monty Python tale! ?????

Joe: yeah sure
